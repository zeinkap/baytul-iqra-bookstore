## üíæ Database Backup & Restore

A robust backup and restore system is in place to protect your data.

### Create a Backup
To create a full backup of your books and categories, run:
```bash
npm run db:backup
```
This command:
- Connects to your database.
- Fetches all book data, including category relations.
- Creates a timestamped JSON backup file (e.g., `books-backup-2025-06-01T12-30-00-000Z.json`).
- Creates a `books-backup-latest.json` file, which is always a copy of the most recent backup.
- Stores all backups in the `backups/` directory.

### Restore from a Backup
To restore your database from a backup, run the interactive restore script:
```bash
npm run db:restore
```
The restoration script will:
1.  List all available backup files from the `backups/` directory.
2.  Prompt you to select which backup to restore from (defaults to the latest).
3.  Warn you if you are about to overwrite existing data.
4.  Delete existing book records if you confirm.
5.  Restore all books and their category relationships from the selected backup file.

### Backup Best Practices
- ‚úÖ **Backup before major changes:** Always create a backup before running a database migration or making significant changes to your data.
- ‚úÖ **Keep multiple versions:** The system automatically stores timestamped backups.
- ‚úÖ **Store backups securely:** Consider committing your `backups/` directory to your Git repository or storing them in a secure cloud location.

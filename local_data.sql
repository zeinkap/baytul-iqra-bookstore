The Book of Intentions a new translation of Kitab al-Niyyat by Habib Muhammad ibn ʿ Alawi al- ʿ Aydarus, better known as Ḥ abīb Sa '' d. In this text, Habib Sa''d explores the transformative power of intention ( niyyah ) in Islamic practice. Rooted in the profound and widely-known hadith that "actions are by intentions," this book guides readers through the process of aligning one''s daily actions with one''s intention and purpose, such that every deed is transformed into an act of worship. Throughout the text, Habib Sa ʿ d emphasizes that the heart''s intentions are more significant than physical actions alone; and that even small acts, when performed with the right intention, can yield immense spiritual rewards. The Book of Intentions is structured around various themes, such as: Visiting the mosque Gathering for prayer Cultivating relationships with fellow believers Ordinary actions of everyday life And more. For each act, the author provides a detailed set of recommended intentions, highlighting the unique rewards associated with each one. Habib Sa ʿ d also cites numerous hadith, along with many insights from the scholars and the tradition, to illustrate the deep-seated importance of intentions in the life of a Muslim. As a whole, this text is a powerful exhortation for the believers to make every permissible action purposeful, including even routine tasks like eating and drinking, waking and sleeping, buying and selling, and being in the company of our family and friends. Through these practical examples, Habib Sa ʿ d illustrates how proper intentions can imbue our daily lives with sanctity and purpose, and help us to live in a continuous state of worship in every moment.

A consummate master of the Qur''anic sciences, Imam al-Suyuti delves deep into the various reasons behind the order of the chapters ( Surahs ) in the Qur''an, revealing layers of meaning and intricate interconnections across many levels of language, meanings, context, purpose, and more. On the effort and research invested in this work, the al-Suyuti writes: “… since few people have spoken on… this subject, the majority of this text is the result of my own contemplation and borne of my own investigation. However, if I do mention something that someone else has said, I explicitly mention its source, and I only mention that which is accepted, which no one has rejected .” In this sense, this text feels quite personal, as it provides a glimpse into Imam''s immense knowledge and capacious intellect. Imam al-Suyuti''s superlative scholarship is unmistakable, as he draws on his knowledge Hadith, Tafsir, history, and the Arabic language to make an extraordinary range of connections and insights. However, despite the obvious brilliance of its author, this work is also easily accessible to readers of all levels. It is meticulously organized to present a coherent flow of ideas and insight, that allows even beginning students to find benefit. The Surahs of the Qur''an are discussed in order, chapter by chapter, with the chapters themselves maintaining a consistent structure. Imam al-Suyuti provides detailed commentary on the placement of each Surah in relation to what comes before it and what will come after it, and what deeper meanings this particular arrangement might signify. His commentary is rich with references to Hadith, historical contexts, and linguistic analyses. Al-Suyuti also frequently quote the opinions and insights of great scholars of earlier generations, adding depth to the text, and situating his own analyses within the vast corpus of scholarship that came before him. One of the most striking features of this book is Imam al-Suyuti''s method of reflection. He does not merely present facts or traditional interpretations, but also engages in a deep, contemplative analysis that unveils some of the hidden wisdom within the Qur''an''s structure. This approach is both scholarly and spiritual, making the work a gem of a read for all. The Imam’s reflections are presented in a manner that invites readers to join him in this contemplative journey, offering a personal and immersive experience of understanding the Qur''an. About Imam al-Suyuti Imam Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, also known as Ibn al-Suyuti, was a mujtahid imam and reformer of the tenth Islamic century. He was a prominent Hadith Master, jurist, Sufi, philologist, and historian, who authored works in virtually every Islamic science.

Researched and compiled with care, it features their profound sayings on topics ranging from faith, integrity, and patience to leadership, justice, and humility. These teachings offer both Muslims and non-Muslims insights into the values that shaped early Islamic leadership and continue to inspire lives today. Whether you seek moral guidance, personal growth, or a deeper understanding of Islamic principles, this book serves as a beacon of wisdom for readers of all backgrounds. Reviews: “Vehapi presents some of the guidance of four great Islamic personalities, who are greatly significant for Muslims, yet are largely ignored in Western literature. The four caliphs are not regarded as mere historic figures by Muslims; they are considered as relevant today as they were ‘historically.’ Vehapi skillfully compiled some of the teachings of these Islamic symbols in a way that is easy to follow by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. His book is highly commendable.” —Imad M. Bayoun, author of Belief and the Human Mind “Living with the Final Prophet enabled his close companions to soak up his profound knowledge, something we can do 1400 years later by studying what they learned from him. The Prophet’s deep insights into the mysteries and contradictions of human nature made his spiritual successors unrivaled teachers of wisdom, something that is sorely lacking in today’s troubled world. Flamur Vehapi deserves our thanks for reconnecting us with this priceless wisdom.” —Joel Hayward, author of The Leadership of Muhammad “An amazing collection of pearls of wisdom … a must read!" —Amber Haque, co-author of Islamic Psychology Around the Globe “An outstanding compilation of enlightenment and guidance extracted from the wisdom and experiences of the best of the Muslim nation (ummah). The content of this book can serve as a life compass for Muslims and others alike.” —Didmar Faja, author of Echoes of the Prophet “ The Book of Great Quotes is more than just the sayings of the early caliphs. It is a superlative synthesis of the very core of Muslim values. It is both succinct and beautiful at once. It is a must read for Muslims and non-Muslims alike that is hard to put down and leaves us wanting more. Vehapi provides us a well documented, easy to read collection of sayings of the first four caliphs of Islam that reminds us what it means to be Muslim." —Brandon Mayfield, author of Grains of Destiny “A delightful collection full of relevant knowledge and gems of wisdom for our time.” —Naser Bresa, author of Retrospectiva and Alo, Komiteti? “Beautifully written … an impressively splendid work.” —Salma Ahmad, president of ISGP, Portland, OR About the author: Flamur Vehapi is a researcher, chronologist, poet, literary translator, academic, and success coach.

Its author, Mawlānā ʿAbd al-ʿAlīm al-Siddīqī (translated by Tahir Mahmood Kiani), underscores the month’s balance: neither indulgence nor ascetic withdrawal, but a disciplined path toward God-consciousness. Alongside clear rulings—covering moonsighting, who must fast, and acts that nullify fasting—the book stresses “moral fasting,” directing believers to guard not only the body but also speech and senses. Emphasis on tarāwīḥ (nightly prayers), iʿtikāf (seclusion in the mosque), and Laylat al-Qadr (the “Night of Great Value”) highlights the month’s spiritual pinnacle. Concluding with Eid al-Fitr, this concise work celebrates Ramadan as a source of purification, communal unity, and deep devotion. Mawlānā Shāh Muḥammad ʿAbd al-ʿAlīm al-Ṣiddīqī Mawlānā Shāh Muḥammad ʿAbd al-ʿAlīm al-Ṣiddīqī was an eminent Islamic scholar and missionary. Born in 1892 in Meerut, he completed Dars-e-Niẓāmī at sixteen and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1917. Continuing his religious studies in Makkah and Madinah, he traveled globally for nearly four decades, spreading Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. His sincere approach, moral conviction, and deep piety drew thousands to Islam, revitalizing dormant communities. He confronted numerous challenges, organized educational conferences, built mosques, authored over a dozen works, and engaged in interfaith dialogue.

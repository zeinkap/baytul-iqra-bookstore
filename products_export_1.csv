Researched and compiled with care, it features their profound sayings on topics ranging from faith, integrity, and patience to leadership, justice, and humility. These teachings offer both Muslims and non-Muslims insights into the values that shaped early Islamic leadership and continue to inspire lives today. Whether you seek moral guidance, personal growth, or a deeper understanding of Islamic principles, this book serves as a beacon of wisdom for readers of all backgrounds.</span><span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reviews:</strong></p>
<p>“Vehapi presents some of the guidance of four great Islamic personalities, who are greatly significant for Muslims, yet are largely ignored in Western literature. The four caliphs are not regarded as mere historic figures by Muslims; they are considered as relevant today as they were ‘historically.’ Vehapi skillfully compiled some of the teachings of these Islamic symbols in a way that is easy to follow by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. His book is highly commendable.” —Imad M. Bayoun, author of Belief and the Human Mind</p>
<p>“Living with the Final Prophet enabled his close companions to soak up his profound knowledge, something we can do 1400 years later by studying what they learned from him. The Prophet’s deep insights into the mysteries and contradictions of human nature made his spiritual successors unrivaled teachers of wisdom, something that is sorely lacking in today’s troubled world. Flamur Vehapi deserves our thanks for reconnecting us with this priceless wisdom.” —Joel Hayward, author of The Leadership of Muhammad</p>
<p>“An amazing collection of pearls of wisdom … a must read!"" —Amber Haque, co-author of Islamic Psychology Around the Globe</p>
<p>“An outstanding compilation of enlightenment and guidance extracted from the wisdom and experiences of the best of the Muslim nation (ummah). The content of this book can serve as a life compass for Muslims and others alike.” —Didmar Faja, author of Echoes of the Prophet</p>
<p>“<em>The Book of Great Quotes</em><span> </span>is more than just the sayings of the early caliphs. It is a superlative synthesis of the very core of Muslim values. It is both succinct and beautiful at once. It is a must read for Muslims and non-Muslims alike that is hard to put down and leaves us wanting more. Vehapi provides us a well documented, easy to read collection of sayings of the first four caliphs of Islam that reminds us what it means to be Muslim."" —Brandon Mayfield, author of Grains of Destiny</p>
<p>“A delightful collection full of relevant knowledge and gems of wisdom for our time.” —Naser Bresa, author of Retrospectiva and Alo, Komiteti?</p>
<p>“Beautifully written … an impressively splendid work.” —Salma Ahmad, president of ISGP, Portland, OR</p>

ramadan-revealed-a-practical-guide-to-fasting-devotion-paperback,Ramadan Revealed: A Practical Guide to Fasting & Devotion [Paperback],"<p><em>Ramadan Revealed: A Practical Guide to Fasting &amp; Devotion</em>, originally titled<span> </span><em>Aḥkām-e-Ramzan al-Mubarak</em><span> </span>in Urdu, succinctly outlines Ramadan’s layered purpose. Its author, Mawlānā ʿAbd al-ʿAlīm al-Siddīqī (translated by Tahir Mahmood Kiani), underscores the month’s balance: neither indulgence nor ascetic withdrawal, but a disciplined path toward God-consciousness. </p>
<p>Alongside clear rulings—covering moonsighting, who must fast, and acts that nullify fasting—the book stresses “moral fasting,” directing believers to guard not only the body but also speech and senses. Emphasis on tarāwīḥ (nightly prayers), iʿtikāf (seclusion in the mosque), and Laylat al-Qadr (the “Night of Great Value”) highlights the month’s spiritual pinnacle. Concluding with Eid al-Fitr, this concise work celebrates Ramadan as a source of purification, communal unity, and deep devotion.</p>
<p><strong>Mawlānā Shāh Muḥammad ʿAbd al-ʿAlīm al-Ṣiddīqī</strong></p>
<p>Mawlānā Shāh Muḥammad ʿAbd al-ʿAlīm al-Ṣiddīqī was an eminent Islamic scholar and missionary. Born in 1892 in Meerut, he completed Dars-e-Niẓāmī at sixteen and earned a bachelor’s degree in 1917. Continuing his religious studies in Makkah and Madinah, he traveled globally for nearly four decades, spreading Islam in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. His sincere approach, moral conviction, and deep piety drew thousands to Islam, revitalizing dormant communities. He confronted numerous challenges, organized educational conferences, built mosques, authored over a dozen works, and engaged in interfaith dialogue. He passed away on 22 Dhū al-Ḥijjah 1372 A.H. in Madinah.</p>

the-book-of-intentions-paperback,The Book of Intentions [Paperback],"<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><i>“I intend.”<br><br></i>With those two words, our lens of perspective, and our entire approach to everything we do, can change.</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>The Book of Intentions</em><span> </span>a new translation of<span> </span><i>Kitab al-Niyyat</i><span> </span>by Habib<i><span> </span></i>Muhammad ibn<span> </span><span>ʿ</span>Alawi al-<span>ʿ</span>Aydarus, better known as<span> </span><span>Ḥ</span>abīb<i><span> </span></i>Sa<span>'</span>d. In this text, Habib Sa'd explores the transformative power of intention (<em>niyyah</em>) in Islamic practice. Rooted in the profound and widely-known hadith that ""actions are by intentions,"" this book guides readers through the process of aligning one's daily actions with one's intention and purpose, such that every deed is transformed into an act of worship. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Throughout the text, Habib<i><span> </span></i>Sa<span>ʿ</span>d emphasizes that the heart's intentions are more significant than physical actions alone; and that even small acts, when performed with the right intention, can yield immense spiritual rewards.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>The Book of Intentions</em><span> </span>is structured around various themes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Visiting the mosque</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Gathering for prayer</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Cultivating relationships with fellow believers</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Ordinary actions of everyday life</li>
</ul>
<p>And more.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For each act, the author provides a detailed set of recommended intentions, highlighting the unique rewards associated with each one. Habib<i> </i>Sa<span>ʿ</span>d also cites numerous hadith, along with many insights from the scholars and the tradition, to illustrate the deep-seated importance of intentions in the life of a Muslim.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As a whole, this text is a powerful exhortation for the believers to make every permissible action purposeful, including even routine tasks like eating and drinking, waking and sleeping, buying and selling, and being in the company of our family and friends. Through these practical examples, Habib<i> </i>Sa<span>ʿ</span>d illustrates how proper intentions can imbue our daily lives with sanctity and purpose, and help us to live in a continuous state of worship in every moment.</p>

inner-dimensions-from-the-order-of-the-surahs-in-the-quran-paperback,Inner Dimensions from the Order of the Surahs in the Qur'an [Paperback],"<p><em>Inner Dimensions from the Order of the Surahs in the Qur'an</em><span> </span>contains Imam al-Suyuti's unique exploration into the structure of the Book of Allah, and specifically the sequence of its chapters in its complete form, at the conclusion of its revelation to Allah's Final Messenger ﷺ. A consummate master of the Qur'anic sciences, Imam al-Suyuti delves deep into the various reasons behind the order of the chapters (<em>Surahs</em>) in the Qur'an, revealing layers of meaning and intricate interconnections across many levels of language, meanings, context, purpose, and more.<br></p>
<p>On the effort and research invested in this work, the al-Suyuti writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…<em>since few people have spoken on… this subject, the majority of this text is the result of my own contemplation and borne of my own investigation. However, if I do mention something that someone else has said, I explicitly mention its source, and I only mention that which is accepted, which no one has rejected</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense, this text feels quite personal, as it provides a glimpse into Imam's immense knowledge and capacious intellect. Imam al-Suyuti's superlative scholarship is unmistakable, as he draws on his knowledge Hadith, Tafsir, history, and the Arabic language to make an extraordinary range of connections and insights.</p>
<p>However, despite the obvious brilliance of its author, this work is also easily accessible to readers of all levels. It is meticulously organized to present a coherent flow of ideas and insight, that allows even beginning students to find benefit. The Surahs of the Qur'an are discussed in order, chapter by chapter, with the chapters themselves maintaining a consistent structure. Imam al-Suyuti provides detailed commentary on the placement of each Surah in relation to what comes before it and what will come after it, and what deeper meanings this particular arrangement might signify. His commentary is rich with references to Hadith, historical contexts, and linguistic analyses. Al-Suyuti also frequently quote the opinions and insights of great scholars of earlier generations, adding depth to the text, and situating his own analyses within the vast corpus of scholarship that came before him.<br></p>
<p>One of the most striking features of this book is Imam al-Suyuti's method of reflection. He does not merely present facts or traditional interpretations, but also engages in a deep, contemplative analysis that unveils some of the hidden wisdom within the Qur'an's structure. This approach is both scholarly and spiritual, making the work a gem of a read for all. The Imam’s reflections are presented in a manner that invites readers to join him in this contemplative journey, offering a personal and immersive experience of understanding the Qur'an.</p>

the-muslim-handbook-of-etiquette-and-manners-paperback,The Muslim Handbook of Etiquette and Manners [Paperback],"<p>This book is a new translation of Imam al-Ghazali's <em>Adab fi al-Din</em>, a concise yet thorough guide to proper Islamic conduct and character in a wide range of life situations. While numerous works discuss adab - translated here as ""etiquette and manners"" - this text stands out for its practical approach, structured in the manner of a handbook for quick and easy reference when the need appears.<br></p>
<p>Al-Ghazali begins by outlining<span> the essential principles that govern all interactions with other people and with oneself, and</span><span> which every Muslim should strive to embody and cultivate within his or her life. He then proceeds to</span><span> </span>a discussion of<span> </span><em>adab</em><span> </span>with Allah, as the relationship with the Creator is at the heart of a Muslim’s character. The Imam details how one may cultivate reverence, humility, and mindfulness in this relationship, and provides practical advice regarding how to consistently remember Allāh, fulfill His commands, and show patience during life’s challenges.</p>
<p>The core of the book is a sort of practical manual of adab, and includes sections on such everyday issues as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Adab of the Scholar, Student, Reciter of the Qur'an, Muhaddith, Khatib, and many other roles related to worship and seeking knowledge</li>
<li>Adab of fasting, eating, drinking, giving and receiving charity, giving and receiving gifts, and of being wealthy or poor</li>
<li>Adab of sleep, waking, being in public and in social gatherings, and other ordinary life situations</li>
<li>Adab of husbands and wives, parents and children, and other relationships</li>
<li>Adab of some common professions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most individual sections occupy no more than one page, with some requiring only a short paragraph to cover the essential issues that guide one's approach to each scenario. The book then concludes with a discussion of universal adab, a general discussion that applies to many disparate areas of life.</p>",Baytul Iqra,Media > Books,"","gazali publishing, paperback",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,,,"",0.0,shopify,1,deny,manual,18.00,,true,false,978-1-952306-03-7,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0732/0879/1270/files/51XQrWw3_jL._SL1360.jpg?v=1741108409,1,"",false,,,784,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,religion-spirituality,,,,,adults,,,,lb,,7.50,active

This was the time when he had gone through ten to eleven years of ridicule and rejection in Makkah, a time when he lost his wife and partner, Khadija, a time when he lost his dear uncle Abu Talib. Allah revealed this precious surah to strengthen the Prophet Muhammad’s heart. To remind him that he lives in the footsteps of the great prophets of the past and that Allah’s help and support is there.</span></p>
<p>This surah is full of meaningful messages of patience, reliance on Allah and how to overcome hardship and betrayal. It was also educational, teaching the Prophet Muhammad the answers to queries that were posed to him by the local Jews and Muslims. Finally this surah was a timely morale booster for the Prophet and his companions in a time of need.</p>

futuwwah-and-raising-males-into-sacred-manhood-paperback,Futuwwah and Raising Males into Sacred Manhood [Paperback],"<p><em>Futuwwah and Raising Males into Sacred Manhood</em><span> </span>concisely discusses the principles within<span> </span><em>futuwwah</em>, or spiritual chivalry, that young men should strive to embody and should inculcate into our communities. While the virtues discusses in this text are not all exclusively related to young males becoming men, this book is tailored towards males, and the specific issues faced by males as they strive to grow into the path of manhood. Just as young women need their own spaces to learn from women how to become honorable sisters, young men require their own special places to instill in them the virtues of upright brothers.</p>
<p>The Islamic tradition calls for a revival of organized training relating to spiritual chivalry and sacred manhood - this is the task of the hour. There are beautiful and majestic qualities embodied by the Prophet s that he passed down to his family members and pious Companions. Those upright men were methodically raised up: they undertook rites of passage, and manly responsibilities which were placed upon them with expectations that they would be executed with excellence.</p>
<p>This book begins by establishing the linguistic and operational<span> </span>definitions of the Arabic word<span> </span><em>futuwwah</em>, translated here as ""spiritual chivalry."" The text then discusses the essential virtues for developing healthy manhood, in a specific order of their priority in teaching. The Qur'anic verses, Prophetic narrations, and sayings of pious Companions and scholars on the subject of<span> </span><em>futuwwah</em><span> </span>are related with sound meaning, accompanied by meticulous citations in footnotes and endnotes.</p>",Baytul Iqra,Media > Books,"","gazali publishing, paperback",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,,,"",0.0,shopify,6,deny,manual,26.00,,true,false,978-1-952306-38-9,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0732/0879/1270/files/617toLEvYeL._SL1500.jpg?v=1740861722,1,"",false,,,5605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,12.50,active

The perfections that Allah bestowed upon the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ encompass every aspect of his blessed being: his outward physical form, his senses, his internal form and his inner beauty. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the most perfect embodiment of created beauty and form, and he is unsurpassed in his perfections. No one can rival or outstrip him in any laudable quality or trait. He knows Allah as He should be known. He fears Allah as He should be feared. He loves Allah as He should be loved. Understanding the Shama’il is absolutely critical to any proper understanding of Islam, for it details the qualities of the message-bearer, which fundamentally alters how we understand the message he brought.</p>

The trunk is the main body that symbolizes our connection with our Creator, and the scattered branches are the life issues that revolve around us. If the trunk suffers from an imbalance, the entire tree feels the effect. The same goes for our connection with Allah. If not careful, one may easily fall into the trap of ghaflah (heedlessness) and lose the important attribute of taqwā, the consciousness of Allah. The best way to improve our connection is by adopting the supplications of the Prophet (PBUH) in our daily tasks. Stay Connected: A Pocket Guide of Prayers for Muslims is a short guidebook for working Muslims on how to reroute the compass of their heart towards Allah on a busy day.

Similarly, the greater a person's perception of Allah's names, the greater their alertness and understanding of life. Nothing passes them by, without thought and contemplation.

When they sense might and awe, they are overcome with the names ""Al-Jabbar"" (The Compeller), ""Al-Muntaqim"" (The Avenger) and ""Al-Qahhar"" (The Subduer).

It is the very Sunnan that has been passed down to us through generations, whether they be known or unknown acts of worship, or those that are neglected, all of which are blessings of Allah the Almighty, only for this nation. Therefore, by adhering to them one increases their own acts of worship, as these Sunnan help to increase and multiply a person's reward. Such a reward was not granted to any previous nation since Allah the Almighty has favored this nation above all nations. He bestows great rewards upon those who hasten to practice such Sunnan, thus, they are greatly sublime, and fruitful.</p>
